            <h1>hi i'm shibtain.</h1>
            <p><b>just a guy that loves design & creative ideas.</b></p>
            <p>i’m a 3rd yr cs student at jmi who loves to design things and work on creative ideas.</p>
            <p>made my first money at 13 via dropshipping.</p>
            <p>started miliamart with my friends in my 2nd year of college and ended up making 20k rs. from this biz.</p>
            <p>most recently, I built <a href="https://www.trakiz.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Trakiz</strong></a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/nitin6404/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this guy</a> during Buildspace Season 5, where we got 24 users registered in the first week of launch.</p>
            <p>received a lot of support from the buildspace community, but closed it because we found we've lost interest.</p>
            <p>currently, I'm a visual design intern at Serri, creating cool ui designs and facebook creatives. wanna see? Nah, it’s confidential—sorry! ;)</p>
